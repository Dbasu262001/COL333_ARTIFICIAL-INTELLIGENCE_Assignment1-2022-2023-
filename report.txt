Problem Statement:
Input: Start_String, i.e., it is the start state.
State_Space: all possible strings, whose length is same as the length of the given string.

Objective Function: Provided for the Assignment. ( We have no work to do on it)
Goal States: State with minimum cost of the objective function.

Core Idea of Algorithm:
=> Local Beam Search, with k successors.

For the Start_State  we computed 'k' best successors.
Each Successor is a string computed by changing a character of the Start_state.(Start_state can be the successor, if the start state is the final goal state).
Maximum Successors of a state(say N)= Length of the input string(Start state) + 1
Now, we have k successor states(or list say S)
Now, for each iteration:
	Compute  the 'successors' of the each state in S, i.e., k*N
	Out of these k*N successors we, choose only k best successors for the next iteration.
No of iterations depends on the time we want to run the program.
For our assignment we choose k =6 (maximum)
No of iterations is 8 under 2sec(for the longest input provided).
We can increase k and N if required.
(Last test case takes around 1.7s)
